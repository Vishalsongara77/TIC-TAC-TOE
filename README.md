# 🧠 Tic Tac Toe (React)

Live Demo: https://vishalsongara77.github.io/TIC-TAC-TOE/

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Tic Tac Toe** is a classic turn-based game built using **React**. This web version allows:
- Two-player gameplay
- Clean, interactive UI
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes

It demonstrates React component structure, state management, and event handling in a game scenario.

## 🎮 Features

- **Interactive gameplay** — players take turns clicking squares
- **Game status updates** — shows whose turn it is
- **Win detection logic** — game alerts when someone wins or if it’s a draw
- **Responsive UI** — works on mobile and desktop

## 🛠 Built With

- **React** — component-based UI
- **CSS** — styling and layout
- **JavaScript** — game logic

## 📖 How It Works

This app uses React’s **state and props** to:
- Track moves and board state
- Detect winning combinations
- Update UI dynamically based on user interactions

The main logic lives in the board component, which checks win conditions after each move.

## 📚 What I Learned

- React component architecture
- Handling user events in React
- Conditional rendering based on game state
- Basic game logic implementation

## 🛠 Future Improvements

- Add AI opponent (single-player mode)
- Animate moves or UI transitions
